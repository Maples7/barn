title: Back-End Web Developer

profile: 
  - I'm a back-end web developer who has a passion for coding. For now I mainly concentrate on Node.js tech stack, but can also share some coding experience on PHP and Python. Moreover, Erlang/Elixir attracts me recently. I love study new tech and have a regular custom to learn from outstanding tech blogs and create my own.
  - I'm very positive about open source and would research how to implement it or just "make the wheel" when I got some good ideas. In high school, I used to attend the NOIP (National Olympiad in Informatics in Provinces) and win the 2rd prize, which lays a solid foundation for my knowledge about Data Structure and Algorithm.
  - Now, I'd like to get a chance to work as a back-end web developer in a great company.

  content: For now I mainly work as a back-end web developer with Node.js tech stack, which involves Express/Koa framework, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis and so on. I also used to briefly build front-end user interface with Vue.js. In other projects, PHP and .NET Core are required for me to work with to build applications. In general, I'm a back-end guy.

      content: Tag and Activity modules are under my responsibility while in building process. And nowadays I have took full responsibility for this project alone, which means a serial of integrated jobs in process pipeline from code to running online including implementation of new demands, routine maintenance, deployment on servers, publish of new version, performance optimization and more. This project is based on Express, MySQL and Redis and consists of 2 parts —— service in user side handles pages' logic and rendering and the one in server side only provides JSON data with pure RESTful APIs for front-end and mobile end. This project gives a deeper thought about document system (Swagger), auto-test (ava/nyc), log system (ELK), standard return format, MVC layer, how to use cache and so on.
    Email Detector: 
      content: With Vue, Koa and MySQL, this comes to be a detector of whether the email service in our company does work well with other email services. By making rules backstage, this service sends emails to other email services through API of our one and try to receive them by IMAP protocol after a while. That IMAP part was my cake while building and I take full responsibility for this project nowadays, too.
    Account Center: 
      content: It's an account center based on old-version PHP who manages all accounts of games and other applications. I meddle in several parts of it on new needs and data analysis.
